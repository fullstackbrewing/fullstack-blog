Let's step through the concept.","cover":"/img/covers/grant-cover.jpg","thumbnail":"/img/covers/grant-cover.jpg","author":"Ben Griffith","email":"griffith.ben@gmail.com","_content":"\n### What is a grant?\n\nA grant is a secondary vessel outside of the mash tun that controls, regulates and (in my case) filters the flow to the boil kettle.\n\n### Why use a grant?\n\nUsing a grant is a great tool when doing all grain brewing.  First, its great for filtering.  During your vorlauf you use this recirculation process to clear the runnings and to set the grain bed.  With the addition of the grant, you are able to set filters in place to pick up any extra particles or husks.  This also holds true when switching over to sparging.  Typically the grain bed stays stable as long as your flow is consistent, but occasionally some junk can come through.  Another great thing is the ability to control flow.  Depending on your setup and where you place your grant, you can let gravity do the work!  We can get more into the mechanics though later in this post.\n\n<!-- more -->\n\n### Part List\n\nFor the grant itself your going to need a few parts.\n* A small stainless container [Amazon](https://www.amazon.com/TableCraft-Products-HU2-Utensil-Stainless/dp/B00FNVR6SK/)\n* A primary filter (flour sifter) [Amazon](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001TR9AW2/)\n* A secondary filter (tea infuser) [Amazon](https://www.amazon.com/Strainer-Bar-Brat-Stainless-Cocktail/dp/B01E08U8GS/)\n* 1/2\" NPT stainless T fitting [BarginFittings](http://www.bargainfittings.com/index.php?route=product/product&keyword=tee&category_id=0&product_id=65)\n* 1/2 Male NPT 3/8 Barb [BargainFittings](http://www.bargainfittings.com/index.php?route=product/product&keyword=barb&category_id=0&product_id=137)\n* 3 x 1/2 Lockout Nuts [BargainFittings](http://www.bargainfittings.com/index.php?route=product/product&keyword=nut&category_id=0&product_id=56)\n* 1/2 NPT Elbow [BargainFittings](http://www.bargainfittings.com/index.php?route=product/product&keyword=elbow&category_id=0&product_id=120)\n* 1/2 NPT Silicon Ring [BargainFittings](http://www.bargainfittings.com/index.php?route=product/product&keyword=silicon&category_id=0&product_id=247)\n\nFor my setup, I have some optional fittings that might help.  However, every setup is a little different.  This is just my version of it.\n\n* 1/2 NPT Camlock F [BargainFittings](http://www.bargainfittings.com/index.php?route=product/product&path=51_54&product_id=133)\n* 1/2 NPT Camlock B [BargainFittings](http://www.bargainfittings.com/index.php?route=product/product&path=51_54&product_id=140)\n\n### Construction\n\nOnce you have the container, the first thing you need to do is cut some holes.  This is probably the most difficult part of the process depending on what tools you have.  It can be done with either a step bit or some kind of knockout punch, but the hole needs to be cut to about 13/16\".  You will need to cut a hole on the side near the top and one on the bottom in the center.  \n\n<div class=\"columns is-multiline\">\n    <div class=\"column is-10 is-offset-1\">\n        <img src=\"{% asset_path grant_hole_1.jpg %}\" alt=\"Side Wall Hole.\"/>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"column is-10 is-offset-1\">\n        <img src=\"{% asset_path grant_hole_2.jpg %}\" alt=\"Bottom Hole.\"/>\n    </div>\n</div>\n\nThe next step is to attach the bottom assembly.  In my case I use camlocks, but any standard 1/2\" threaded nipple would work.  Use a locknut on the outside and on the inside to tighten.

The first filter is the secondary filter.  This filter grabs all of the tiny particles that might come through while vorlaufing.  The next is the primary filter, which grabs most of the grain husks and larger particles that come through initially.\n\n<div class=\"columns is-multiline\">\n    <div class=\"column is-10 is-offset-1\">\n        <img src=\"{% asset_path grant_filter_secondary.jpg %}\" alt=\"Secondary Filter (Tea Filter)\"/>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"column is-10 is-offset-1\">\n        <img src=\"{% asset_path grant_filter_primary.jpg %}\" alt=\"Primary Filter (Flour Sifter).\"/>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"column is-10 is-offset-1\">\n        <img src=\"{% asset_path grant_filter_secondary_installed.jpg %}\" alt=\"Secondary Filter Installed.\"/>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"column is-10 is-offset-1\">\n        <img src=\"{% asset_path grant_filter_primary_installed.jpg %}\" alt=\"Primary Filter Installed.\"/>\n    </div>\n</div>\n\nAfter the bottom assembly is added, we can mount up the top assembly.

In this setup, I have my mash tun and grant sitting next to each other.

When starting the vorlauf, I am able to open up the valve fully and leave it.  The hydrostatic pressure produced from within the mash tun will create a smooth and consistent linear flow.  The rate of flow is then determined by the rate in which you add sparge water later on.  Want it to go faster, sparge faster.\n\n2. The hydrostatic pressure will push the wort up through the pipe and into the grant.  Let gravity do all the work!  Now the grant can start to filter our runnings.\n\n3. Once the grant starts to fill, it will prime the pump.  The pump will be used to pump the wort back up to the top of the mash tun.\n\n4. The valve at the top of the mash tun will regulate the level of wort within the grant.  Since the flow from the mash tun into the grant will be much slower than the flow the pump can produce, we need a way to slow that down.  Otherwise, the pump would empty the grant and lose its prime.\n","source":"_posts/How-to-make-a-grant.md","raw":"---\ntitle: How to make a grant\ncatalog: false\ndate: 2016-12-06 22:40:51\ntags:\n- mash tun\n- grant\n- engineering\nsubtitle: Building a grant yourself is actually pretty easy.  Let's step through the concept.\ncover: /img/covers/grant-cover.jpg\nthumbnail: /img/covers/grant-cover.jpg\ncategory:\n- hardware\nauthor: Ben Griffith\nemail: griffith.ben@gmail.com\n---\n\n### What is a grant?\n\nA grant is a secondary vessel outside of the mash tun that controls, regulates and (in my case) filters the flow to the boil kettle.\n\n### Why use a grant?\n\nUsing a grant is a great tool when doing all grain brewing.  First, its great for filtering.  During your vorlauf you use this recirculation process to clear the runnings and to set the grain bed.  With the addition of the grant, you are able to set filters in place to pick up any extra particles or husks.  This also holds true when switching over to sparging.  Typically the grain bed stays stable as long as your flow is consistent, but occasionally some junk can come through.  Another great thing is the ability to control flow.  Depending on your setup and where you place your grant, you can let gravity do the work!  We can get more into the mechanics though later in this post.\n\n<!-- more -->\n\n### Part List\n\nFor the grant itself your going to need a few parts.\n* A small stainless container [Amazon](https://www.amazon.com/TableCraft-Products-HU2-Utensil-Stainless/dp/B00FNVR6SK/)\n* A primary filter (flour sifter) [Amazon](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001TR9AW2/)\n* A secondary filter (tea infuser) [Amazon](https://www.amazon.com/Strainer-Bar-Brat-Stainless-Cocktail/dp/B01E08U8GS/)\n* 1/2\" NPT stainless T fitting [BarginFittings](http://www.bargainfittings.com/index.php?route=product/product&keyword=tee&category_id=0&product_id=65)\n* 1/2 Male NPT 3/8 Barb [BargainFittings](http://www.bargainfittings.com/index.php?route=product/product&keyword=barb&category_id=0&product_id=137)\n* 3 x 1/2 Lockout Nuts [BargainFittings](http://www.bargainfittings.com/index.php?route=product/product&keyword=nut&category_id=0&product_id=56)\n* 1/2 NPT Elbow [BargainFittings](http://www.bargainfittings.com/index.php?route=product/product&keyword=elbow&category_id=0&product_id=120)\n* 1/2 NPT Silicon Ring [BargainFittings](http://www.bargainfittings.com/index.php?route=product/product&keyword=silicon&category_id=0&product_id=247)\n\nFor my setup, I have some optional fittings that might help.  However, every setup is a little different.  This is just my version of it.\n\n* 1/2 NPT Camlock F [BargainFittings](http://www.bargainfittings.com/index.php?route=product/product&path=51_54&product_id=133)\n* 1/2 NPT Camlock B [BargainFittings](http://www.bargainfittings.com/index.php?route=product/product&path=51_54&product_id=140)\n\n### Construction\n\nOnce you have the container, the first thing you need to do is cut some holes.  This is probably the most difficult part of the process depending on what tools you have.  It can be done with either a step bit or some kind of knockout punch, but the hole needs to be cut to about 13/16\".  You will need to cut a hole on the side near the top and one on the bottom in the center.  \n\n<div class=\"columns is-multiline\">\n    <div class=\"column is-10 is-offset-1\">\n        <img src=\"{% asset_path grant_hole_1.jpg %}\" alt=\"Side Wall Hole.\"/>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"column is-10 is-offset-1\">\n        <img src=\"{% asset_path grant_hole_2.jpg %}\" alt=\"Bottom Hole.\"/>\n    </div>\n</div>\n\nThe next step is to attach the bottom assembly.  In my case I use camlocks, but any standard 1/2\" threaded nipple would work.  Use a locknut on the outside and on the inside to tighten.  Be sure to put the silicon ring on the outside of the vessel.\n\n<div class=\"columns is-multiline\">\n    <div class=\"column is-10 is-offset-1\">\n        <img src=\"{% asset_path grant_bottom_assembly.jpg %}\" alt=\"Bottom Bulk Head\"/>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"column is-10 is-offset-1\">\n        <img src=\"{% asset_path grant_bottom_assembly_attached.jpg %}\" alt=\"Bottom Bulk Head Attached.\"/>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"column is-10 is-offset-1\">\n        <img src=\"{% asset_path grant_bottom_assembly_attached_inside.jpg %}\" alt=\"Bottom Bulk Head Attached Inside View.\"/>\n    </div>\n</div>\n\nAfter the bottom assembly is added, you can put in the filters.

They work exceptionally well, holding a temp with only a 1&deg;F drop over the course of an hour (on a really cold day).  But, I wanted to make some bigger beers.  At most, the cooler could hold about 12kg of malt @ 2.5L/KG of water.\n\n<!-- more -->\n\n<div class=\"columns is-multiline\">\n    <div class=\"column is-10 is-offset-1\">\n        <img src=\"{% asset_path the-cooler.jpg %}\" alt=\"10 Gallon Rubbermaid Mash Tun.\"/>\n    </div>\n</div>\n\n### So Where to Go Next?\n\nThe obvious step is to move up in size, however thats easier said than done.  If you want to keep from moving to a RIMS or HERMS system, and use a single infusion mash, your options are kind of limited.  One, you can move to a larger square cooler.  This would work great, but depending on your workflow it might not work.  Another option is moving to a keg.  Which is what I chose.\n\n### The Keg\n\nI ended up finding a rubberized 15.5 gallon keg.  I specifically wanted a rubber one hoping it would have some kind of insulative properties (more on that, and lack thereof later).\n\n<div class=\"columns is-multiline\">\n    <div class=\"column is-10 is-offset-1\">\n        <img src=\"{% asset_path the-start.jpg %}\" alt=\"15.5 Gallon Rubber Keg.\"/>\n    </div>\n</div>\n\n### Top or Bottom?\n\nThe first decision was where to make the first cut.  Traditionally most seem to punch a hole in the side and run a line to a domed false bottom.  However, after stumbling across the blog post from [Buttcrack Brewery](http://www.buttcrackbrewery.com/2012/02/25/insulated-kegmash-tun/) I decided to cut the bottom and flip the keg over.  This would allow me to attach a 2\" TC Clamp to the keg opening after the stem was removed.  I saw this as having two main benefits:\n\n<strong>One:</strong> less hardware and connections to deal with.  I am of a philosophy of less stuff will result in less issues down the road.  Having multiple threads and connections could possibly result in more.  \n\n<strong>Two:</strong> 0 deadspace.  Running through the original opening of the keg will bring all of the wort to a central location.  Dumping from the bottom-most spot of the keg will reduce the amount of waste you can have.\n\n### Lets Cut!\n\nFirst, drill a pilot hole in the center of the bottom.  You will use this as a pivot point to draw your guide to cut on.  I drew a line around about an inch away from the lip edge so I would be able to place a lid on top.  Using an angle grinder with a stainless cutting wheel, take some small passes at the rubber exterior.  Be sure to wear breathing protection.  I didn't and completely regret it.  This rubbery dust goes everywhere.\n\n<div class=\"columns is-multiline\">\n    <div class=\"column is-10 is-offset-1\">\n        <img src=\"{% asset_path remove-rubber.jpg %}\" alt=\"Grind off the rubber.\"/>\n    </div>\n</div>\n\nNext, we move on to the fun part, grinding through stainless!  Pretty straight forward, follow the same path as the removed rubber.  Be sure to take small passes.  Since you are grinding in a circle you don't want to try and bend the grinding wheel, they are not flexible and grinder shrapnel sucks.\n\n<div class=\"columns is-multiline\">\n    <div class=\"column is-10 is-offset-1\">\n        <img src=\"{% asset_path remove-stainless.jpg %}\" alt=\"Cut through the stainless.\"/>\n    </div>\n</div>\n\n### Going to Need a Lid.\n\nOriginally I had planned to cut a lid out of a 12\"x12\" board.  Somehow I was thinking I would use a skill saw to cut a perfect 12\" circle from the center and it would fit nicely.  As I was browsing the wood section at the hardware stare, I came upon a 12\" barstool top.  It was perfect!  Dense, 12\" perfect circle, and under $3!\n\n<div class=\"columns is-multiline\">\n    <div class=\"column is-10 is-offset-1\">\n        <img src=\"{% asset_path start-of-lid.jpg %}\" alt=\"12in Barstool Top as a Lid\"/>\n    </div>\n</div>\n\nOne of the features I needed in a lid with my setup was to be able to setup a sparge arm.  Simple enough, get a 3/8\" copper coil from your local hardware store.  Wrap it, drill it and you're all set.\n\n<div class=\"columns is-multiline\">\n    <div class=\"column is-10 is-offset-1\">\n        <img src=\"{% asset_path lid-coil.jpg %}\" alt=\"3/8in Copper Coil with small holes drilled in it.\"/>\n    </div>\n</div>\n\nNow, I know what your thinking.  Wood isn't a good choice, thats going to absorb a bunch of water and get skanky. But wait!  Theres a solution to this.  Wrap that sucka in silicone!\n\n<div class=\"columns is-multiline\">\n    <div class=\"column is-10 is-offset-1\">\n        <img src=\"{% asset_path lid-silicone-bottom.jpg %}\" alt=\"12in Microwave Silicone.\"/>\n    </div>\n</div>\n\nWe are also going to need to make a seal around the edge.  What I ended up using was 1/2\" ID Silicone Tubing cut long ways.  Wrapped that around the edge of the lid and adhered with liquid silicone.  For my application I needed to do this twice to get enough thickness to meet the outside edge of the keg and to form a proper seal.\n\n<div class=\"columns is-multiline\">\n    <div class=\"column is-10 is-offset-1\">\n        <img src=\"{% asset_path lid-silicone-edge.jpg %}\" alt=\"Edge Wrapped in 1/2in Cut Silicone Tubing.\"/>\n    </div>\n</div>\n\nThis ultimately covers the wooded surface area in silicone, increasing the lifetime of the lid. Will this lid last forever?  Probably not.  But on a homebrew scale, it's put together cheaply enough that it can be replaced.\n\n### What about the vorlauf?\n\nHaving a return port on your tun is incredibly useful.  When I first started out, like most, I vorlaufed with a pitcher.  Filling it up, pouring it slowly into the top.  Rinse, lather, repeat.  I found it tiresome and a part of the brewing process I did not enjoy.  With the help of a pump and <a href=\"http://www.fullstackbrewing.com/2016/12/06/How-to-make-a-grant/\" target=\"_blank\">a grant</a>, it made things a lot easier.  To control the flow-rate I added in a bulkhead with a ball valve.  Now I can let the pump do all the heavy lifting for me!\n\n<div class=\"columns is-multiline\">\n    <div class=\"column is-10 is-offset-1\">\n        <img src=\"{% asset_path vorlauf-fitting.jpg %}\" alt=\"Punch a hole and put in a bulk head.\"/>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"column is-10 is-offset-1\">\n        <img src=\"{% asset_path vorlauf.jpg %}\" alt=\"Added a valve for vorlauf flow rate control\"/>\n    </div>\n</div>\n\nOne issue with having a fixed return port is grain bed height.  If you are doing a lighter beer with less grain, your bed is obviously going to be lower.  With that, your vorlauf return flow is going to fall much further and punch down through the grain bed, which isn't ideal.  The solution I came up with is a series of linked T-Fittings with a plug in the bottom.  That way the direct flow won't go straight down, but come out in stages.\n\n<div class=\"columns is-multiline\">\n    <div class=\"column is-10 is-offset-1\">\n        <img src=\"{% asset_path vorlauf-return.jpg %}\" alt=\"Multi-Step Vorlauf Return.\"/>\n    </div>\n</div>\n\n### The False Bottom\n\nAs mentioned before, I decided to use the existing sanke connection as the bottom of my mash tun.  This provided a central point for the wort to flow out of the mash tun.  Using a setup from NorCal Brewing Solutions, I was able to attach a 2\" Tri-Clamp fitting to the bottom with a 1/2\" NPT elbow and pipe.  On the inside, I put in a PICO Keg/Keggle False Bottom Assembly.  \n\n<div class=\"columns is-multiline\">\n    <div class=\"column is-half\">\n        <img src=\"{% asset_path norcal-tri-clover-sanke-adapter.jpg %}\" alt=\"NorCal Brewing Solutions Tri-Clamp Mash Tun Fitting.\" />\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"column is-half\">\n        <img src=\"{% asset_path false-bottom.jpg %}\" alt=\"PICO Keg/Keggle False Bottom Assembly.\" />\n    </div>\n</div>\n\nDoing it this way will also require you to create a small stand to set the mash tun on.  A few chunks of scrap 2x4 did the trick.\n\n<div class=\"columns is-multiline\">\n    <div class=\"column is-10 is-offset-1\">\n        <img src=\"{% asset_path false-bottom-installed.jpg %}\" alt=\"False Bottom Installed.\"/>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"column is-10 is-offset-1\">\n        <img src=\"{% asset_path dry-run.jpg %}\" alt=\"Dry run with the mash tun on a simple stand.\"/>\n    </div>\n</div>\n\n### Tips\n\nSo I have started writing this blog post over a few months, and have actually used this setup a few times since starting. There have been a few things I have come accross that have been pretty helpful.\n\n#### 1.  Pre-Heat the Tun!  \n\nWith a kettle like this the stainless and rubber need to be pre-heated.  From what I have found the heat absorption rate is slow, so if you strike and hit your temp when the kettle is cold it will slowly drop 6-8 degrees.  This is due to the stainless and rubber slowly absorbing the heat and not retaining it.  However, if you pre-heat your kettle with some hot tap water before striking, your heat loss will be less severe (maybe 1-2 degree depending on your ambient temp).\n\n#### 2.  Make sure your false bottom has a good seal\n\nOriginally I had a 13\" hinged false bottom.  In most cases this works great!  However, in my case my keg had dents and dings on the bottom of it (or top since I used the sanke port).  This caused the stainless to not get a great seal, allowing a bunch of grain to pass by the false bottom.  This in turn would clog my grant and create some initial headaches in the vorlauf process.\n","source":"_posts/Mash-Tun-Overhaul.md","raw":"---\ntitle: Mash Tun Overhaul\ncatalog: false\ndate: 2017-05-20 12:00:00\ntags:\n- keg\n- mash tun\n- engineering\nsubtitle: Scaling up from a 10 to a 15 gallon mash tun.\ncover: /img/covers/mash-tun-cover.jpg\nthumbnail: /img/covers/mash-tun-cover.jpg\ncategory:\n- hardware\nauthor: Ben Griffith\nemail: griffith.ben@gmail.com\n---\n\n### I Outgrew the Cooler\n\nLike a lot that move to all grain, you start out with a 10 gallon water cooler.

To start, we are heading off to the Missouri Beer Festival in Columbia, MO.  Through our local homebrew club, [The Worts](http://theworts.com), homebrewers can serve beer to the public and get some really great feedback. This year we brought a few new beers to the scene:\n\n<!-- more -->\n\n#### Bliple - Black Belgian Tripel - 10.5% ABV\nBliple is a take on converting a typically light colored style to the dark side.

It is an old brewing process, that involves using super heated rocks\nadded to the wort to boil it. This process dates back to the early days of brewing, before the introduction of large\nmetal kettles which could be heated by flame to produce a boil.\n\n<!-- more -->\n\nI can’t recall when it was that I learned about steinbiers but I have been intrigued by the idea ever since and had been hoping to try it out. I’d spent the year of 2018 trying out many different new beer styles and weird ingredients so I figured there was no better way to end 2018: My Year of Weird, than with a stienbier brew. Plus, a bonfire while making beer sounds like a great time to me. \n\nBefore I get too much further along, I’d like to give a big shoutout to the folks at [Scratch Brewing](https://www.scratchbeer.com) in Ava, IL. They have made several stienbiers in the past and gave me some helpful advice when I was in the research phase of this brew. If you haven’t had any of their beers or been to their brewery, I highly suggest you make it a priority!\n\n### Where Do You Get The Stones?!\n\nThe major component of a steinbier is the stone that you use. Not just any rock will work as you will need something that can withstand being super heated and then cooled to 212F to boil your wort. Igneous-types of stone like granite and soapstone are great candidates. What you use will depend on what is available to you. \n\nThere are a couple different ways of incorporating the stones. One of the most common I have found simply just involves using the rocks in the boil and heating everything else like you would any other brew day but there are folks who use the stones as a sole method of heating everything or even dropped into the mash along with the grains. I opted for the “rocks only in the boil” technique to keep it simple my first time around.\n\nI decided to use granite as I figured it would be the easiest for me to source. I started out by calling a local countertop shop to see if they had any scrap I could use. They kindly allowed me to scavenge their scrap field and pick out whatever I wanted. \n\n<div class=\"columns is-multiline\">\n    <div class=\"column is-10 is-offset-1\">\n        <img src=\"{% asset_path stones.jpg %}\" alt=\"Scrap Countertop Granite.\"/>\n    </div>\n</div>\n\nI grabbed about 16 or so fist-sized chunks of what looked like granite countertop scrap. However, I found myself second guessing the quality of the scrap and if it would be good for my purposes or not. I eventually stumbled across a [video from Sixpoint Brewery](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJV3OAzYJdo) that documented their process of brewing a stienbier. They had sourced granite counter scrap similar to mine and decided not to use it as it easily broke in half after one use. While I would be using a different technique than they employed, I also decided to look elsewhere for my stones.\n\nFortunately, my girlfriend’s father used to work construction and had several large blocks of granite left over from a previous job. He and I went out and hit one with a sledge hammer several times to produce chunks of raw Missouri granite that would be perfect for my stienbier.  I took home a 5gal bucket full of granite rocks and then refined some of the sharper edges with a hammer and chisel to reduce the likelihood of any of the edges from shattering off into my kettle due to the heat. \n\nI knew moving super heated rocks from a fire to my kettle would be difficult and  didn’t really own any tongs that would work well for the job. I found these 26in [firewood tongs](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B01N654UZY/) on Amazon and decided to give them a shot. I’m happy to report they worked well. They are pretty thin so grabbing a rock the wrong way could easily mean accidentally dropping it so you need to make sure you have a good grip with them.\n\n<div class=\"columns is-multiline\">\n    <div class=\"column is-10 is-offset-1\">\n        <img src=\"{% asset_path firewood-tongs.jpg %}\" alt=\"Firewood Tongs in Action!\"/>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"column is-10 is-offset-1\">\n        <img src=\"{% asset_path stones-in-wort.jpg %}\" alt=\"Stones and trub left in the kettle after the transfer..\"/>\n    </div>\n</div>\n\n### Local Malts, Cedar Tips, and Kveik!\n\nWhile making a stienbier was unique enough, I wanted to go a little further with it. I had recently learned a small, artisan maltster in my area who had opened up earlier in 2018. They specialized in malting grains grown in the Midwest, including some red wheat that was grown just a couple counties over from where I live. I was super excited about the idea of using locally grown and malted grains in this beer so I reached out to [Gateway Custom Malts](http://gatewaymalt.com) to see if I could get my hands on some of their malts. Not only did I get the malts but I was given a tour of their facility in Montgomery City which was pretty awesome.\n\nI also decided to try an ingredient I had been wanting to use for a while. Eastern Red Cedar is very common here in my area of the country. It is technically a species of juniper and it can be used in brewing in many different forms including the bark, berries and tips of the green branches. While the nuances of the flavor and aroma from the cedar tips can vary depending on location and time of year, the usually put off a crisp orange peel aroma and produce a piney green gin-like flavor.\n\n<div class=\"columns is-multiline\">\n    <div class=\"column is-10 is-offset-1\">\n        <img src=\"{% asset_path cedar-prep.jpg %}\" alt=\"Cedar Preparation.\"/>\n    </div>\n</div>\n\nOnce again, the folks at Scratch Brewing helped me out here. I referenced their [“The Homebrewer’s Almanac”](https://www.amazon.com/Homebrewers-Almanac-Seasonal-Making-Scratch/dp/1581573499) many times during the planning process for tips on brewing with cedar. If you are into using hyper local or foraged ingredients in your brews, this book is a fantastic reference!\n\nBefore we get to the recipe, I’d like to talk about yeast choice. On a commercial scale, steinbiers are typically lagers. As far as I can find, there isn’t much of a reason behind this other than it’s just what has always been done. Since “steinbier” is more of a process vs a style, any yeast will do the job. Since I would not be able to provide very accurate temperature control for this beer, I decided to try [Omega’s HotHead](https://omegayeast.com/yeast/norwegian-ales/hothead-ale). It is a strain of kviek yeast, which would play into some of the traditional Norwegian aspects of this beer by using cedar and boiling with rocks. Also, it can ferment at temps up to 98F which is ideal for the type of fermentation I was going to need to do with this beer. \n\nI grabbed a pack from my local shop but found it to be nearly 6 months old. I was a little nervous at first as it should have lost a lot of viability at that point. However, after talking to some folks who had worked with it before, they suggested that HotHead works really well when under-pitched and the smaller cell count wouldn’t have an issue with the higher gravity of my recipe. In short, don’t worry about under pitching this yeast. It had no issues getting going and making a great beer!\n\n### Recipe\n###### Taken for Granite - Cedar stienbier - 5gal\nOG: 1.068\n24 IBu\n5.7SRM\n\n###### Malt\n10lb \tGateway Custom Malt Violetta 2 Row\n2lb \tGateway Custom Malt Soft Red Winter Wheat\n.25lb\tCaramel 40\n\n###### Hops\n1oz Hallertau \t60min\n1oz Citra\t10min\n\n###### Yeast\nOmega OYL-057 HotHead Ale\n\n###### Miscellaneous\n6oz of green Eastern Red Cedar tips split between mash and sparge water.\n\n### Steps\n\nBuild a large fire around your stones and light it about 3-4 hours before you plan to boil your wort. You may need to\nkeep feeding the fire so it stays warm. Hardwoods like oak and elm will burn nice and hot and are excellent choices for\nfuel.\n\n<div class=\"columns is-multiline\">\n    <div class=\"column is-10 is-offset-1\">\n        <img src=\"{% asset_path fire.jpg %}\" alt=\"Heating up the Granite.\"/>\n    </div>\n</div>\n\nAfter the fire has burned for a couple hours, go ahead and prepare your mash. I choose to aim for a mash temp of 154F\nfor a nice medium-full bodied beer but this is open to your interpretation if you would like to try something different.\nAfter mixing in the grains, I picked off about 3oz of cedar tips and threw them into the mash and stirred them in. If\nyou think a normal mash smells great and the smell of cedar is pleasant to you, prepare for some pretty awesome mash\nsmells.\n\n<div class=\"columns is-multiline\">\n    <div class=\"column is-10 is-offset-1\">\n        <img src=\"{% asset_path mash2.jpg %}\" alt=\"Mashing In.\"/>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"column is-10 is-offset-1\">\n        <img src=\"{% asset_path mash1.jpg %}\" alt=\"Adding the Cedar to the Mash.\"/>\n    </div>\n</div>\n\nI let it mash for 1 hour and then prepared my sparge water while I waited. I heated my sparge water to 165F and added 3\nmore ounces of cedar tips into the water in order to infuse it with those great cedar flavors. Once the hour timer was\nup, I ran out the wort from the tun into my boil kettle and batch sparged with the cedar water to my boil volume.\n\n<div class=\"columns is-multiline\">\n    <div class=\"column is-10 is-offset-1\">\n        <img src=\"{% asset_path sparge-cedar.jpg %}\" alt=\"Adding the Cedar to the Sparge Water.\"/>\n    </div>\n</div>\n\nThis is where the fun begins. Using the tongs, grab a couple stones from the fire, one at a time, and place them in the\nkettle. Be careful to avoid splashing. Depending on the temperature of the wort, it may take a couple stones to get the\nwort to boil. Once it does get to a boil, it will boil vigorously. Add a stone about every 10min or whenever you notice\nthe surface of the wort stop to boil. Add your hop additions at their indicated times and enjoy the process.

It is an old brewing process, that involves using super heated rocks\nadded to the wort to boil it. This process dates back to the early days of brewing, before the introduction of large\nmetal kettles which could be heated by flame to produce a boil.\n\n<!-- more -->\n\nI can’t recall when it was that I learned about steinbiers but I have been intrigued by the idea ever since and had been hoping to try it out. I’d spent the year of 2018 trying out many different new beer styles and weird ingredients so I figured there was no better way to end 2018: My Year of Weird, than with a stienbier brew. Plus, a bonfire while making beer sounds like a great time to me. \n\nBefore I get too much further along, I’d like to give a big shoutout to the folks at [Scratch Brewing](https://www.scratchbeer.com) in Ava, IL. They have made several stienbiers in the past and gave me some helpful advice when I was in the research phase of this brew. If you haven’t had any of their beers or been to their brewery, I highly suggest you make it a priority!\n\n### Where Do You Get The Stones?!\n\nThe major component of a steinbier is the stone that you use. Not just any rock will work as you will need something that can withstand being super heated and then cooled to 212F to boil your wort. Igneous-types of stone like granite and soapstone are great candidates. What you use will depend on what is available to you. \n\nThere are a couple different ways of incorporating the stones. One of the most common I have found simply just involves using the rocks in the boil and heating everything else like you would any other brew day but there are folks who use the stones as a sole method of heating everything or even dropped into the mash along with the grains. I opted for the “rocks only in the boil” technique to keep it simple my first time around.\n\nI decided to use granite as I figured it would be the easiest for me to source. I started out by calling a local countertop shop to see if they had any scrap I could use. They kindly allowed me to scavenge their scrap field and pick out whatever I wanted. \n\n<div class=\"columns is-multiline\">\n    <div class=\"column is-10 is-offset-1\">\n        <img src=\"{% asset_path stones.jpg %}\" alt=\"Scrap Countertop Granite.\"/>\n    </div>\n</div>\n\nI grabbed about 16 or so fist-sized chunks of what looked like granite countertop scrap. However, I found myself second guessing the quality of the scrap and if it would be good for my purposes or not. I eventually stumbled across a [video from Sixpoint Brewery](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJV3OAzYJdo) that documented their process of brewing a stienbier. They had sourced granite counter scrap similar to mine and decided not to use it as it easily broke in half after one use. While I would be using a different technique than they employed, I also decided to look elsewhere for my stones.\n\nFortunately, my girlfriend’s father used to work construction and had several large blocks of granite left over from a previous job. He and I went out and hit one with a sledge hammer several times to produce chunks of raw Missouri granite that would be perfect for my stienbier.  I took home a 5gal bucket full of granite rocks and then refined some of the sharper edges with a hammer and chisel to reduce the likelihood of any of the edges from shattering off into my kettle due to the heat. \n\nI knew moving super heated rocks from a fire to my kettle would be difficult and  didn’t really own any tongs that would work well for the job. I found these 26in [firewood tongs](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B01N654UZY/) on Amazon and decided to give them a shot. I’m happy to report they worked well. They are pretty thin so grabbing a rock the wrong way could easily mean accidentally dropping it so you need to make sure you have a good grip with them.\n\n<div class=\"columns is-multiline\">\n    <div class=\"column is-10 is-offset-1\">\n        <img src=\"{% asset_path firewood-tongs.jpg %}\" alt=\"Firewood Tongs in Action!\"/>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"column is-10 is-offset-1\">\n        <img src=\"{% asset_path stones-in-wort.jpg %}\" alt=\"Stones and trub left in the kettle after the transfer..\"/>\n    </div>\n</div>\n\n### Local Malts, Cedar Tips, and Kveik!\n\nWhile making a stienbier was unique enough, I wanted to go a little further with it. I had recently learned a small, artisan maltster in my area who had opened up earlier in 2018. They specialized in malting grains grown in the Midwest, including some red wheat that was grown just a couple counties over from where I live. I was super excited about the idea of using locally grown and malted grains in this beer so I reached out to [Gateway Custom Malts](http://gatewaymalt.com) to see if I could get my hands on some of their malts. Not only did I get the malts but I was given a tour of their facility in Montgomery City which was pretty awesome.\n\nI also decided to try an ingredient I had been wanting to use for a while. Eastern Red Cedar is very common here in my area of the country. It is technically a species of juniper and it can be used in brewing in many different forms including the bark, berries and tips of the green branches. While the nuances of the flavor and aroma from the cedar tips can vary depending on location and time of year, the usually put off a crisp orange peel aroma and produce a piney green gin-like flavor.\n\n<div class=\"columns is-multiline\">\n    <div class=\"column is-10 is-offset-1\">\n        <img src=\"{% asset_path cedar-prep.jpg %}\" alt=\"Cedar Preparation.\"/>\n    </div>\n</div>\n\nOnce again, the folks at Scratch Brewing helped me out here. I referenced their [“The Homebrewer’s Almanac”](https://www.amazon.com/Homebrewers-Almanac-Seasonal-Making-Scratch/dp/1581573499) many times during the planning process for tips on brewing with cedar. If you are into using hyper local or foraged ingredients in your brews, this book is a fantastic reference!\n\nBefore we get to the recipe, I’d like to talk about yeast choice. On a commercial scale, steinbiers are typically lagers. As far as I can find, there isn’t much of a reason behind this other than it’s just what has always been done. Since “steinbier” is more of a process vs a style, any yeast will do the job. Since I would not be able to provide very accurate temperature control for this beer, I decided to try [Omega’s HotHead](https://omegayeast.com/yeast/norwegian-ales/hothead-ale). It is a strain of kviek yeast, which would play into some of the traditional Norwegian aspects of this beer by using cedar and boiling with rocks. Also, it can ferment at temps up to 98F which is ideal for the type of fermentation I was going to need to do with this beer. \n\nI grabbed a pack from my local shop but found it to be nearly 6 months old. I was a little nervous at first as it should have lost a lot of viability at that point. However, after talking to some folks who had worked with it before, they suggested that HotHead works really well when under-pitched and the smaller cell count wouldn’t have an issue with the higher gravity of my recipe. In short, don’t worry about under pitching this yeast. It had no issues getting going and making a great beer!\n\n### Recipe\n###### Taken for Granite - Cedar stienbier - 5gal\nOG: 1.068\n24 IBu\n5.7SRM\n\n###### Malt\n10lb \tGateway Custom Malt Violetta 2 Row\n2lb \tGateway Custom Malt Soft Red Winter Wheat\n.25lb\tCaramel 40\n\n###### Hops\n1oz Hallertau \t60min\n1oz Citra\t10min\n\n###### Yeast\nOmega OYL-057 HotHead Ale\n\n###### Miscellaneous\n6oz of green Eastern Red Cedar tips split between mash and sparge water.\n\n### Steps\n\nBuild a large fire around your stones and light it about 3-4 hours before you plan to boil your wort. You may need to\nkeep feeding the fire so it stays warm. Hardwoods like oak and elm will burn nice and hot and are excellent choices for\nfuel.\n\n<div class=\"columns is-multiline\">\n    <div class=\"column is-10 is-offset-1\">\n        <img src=\"{% asset_path fire.jpg %}\" alt=\"Heating up the Granite.\"/>\n    </div>\n</div>\n\nAfter the fire has burned for a couple hours, go ahead and prepare your mash. I choose to aim for a mash temp of 154F\nfor a nice medium-full bodied beer but this is open to your interpretation if you would like to try something different.\nAfter mixing in the grains, I picked off about 3oz of cedar tips and threw them into the mash and stirred them in. If\nyou think a normal mash smells great and the smell of cedar is pleasant to you, prepare for some pretty awesome mash\nsmells.\n\n<div class=\"columns is-multiline\">\n    <div class=\"column is-10 is-offset-1\">\n        <img src=\"{% asset_path mash2.jpg %}\" alt=\"Mashing In.\"/>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"column is-10 is-offset-1\">\n        <img src=\"{% asset_path mash1.jpg %}\" alt=\"Adding the Cedar to the Mash.\"/>\n    </div>\n</div>\n\nI let it mash for 1 hour and then prepared my sparge water while I waited. I heated my sparge water to 165F and added 3\nmore ounces of cedar tips into the water in order to infuse it with those great cedar flavors. Once the hour timer was\nup, I ran out the wort from the tun into my boil kettle and batch sparged with the cedar water to my boil volume.\n\n<div class=\"columns is-multiline\">\n    <div class=\"column is-10 is-offset-1\">\n        <img src=\"{% asset_path sparge-cedar.jpg %}\" alt=\"Adding the Cedar to the Sparge Water.\"/>\n    </div>\n</div>\n\nThis is where the fun begins. Using the tongs, grab a couple stones from the fire, one at a time, and place them in the\nkettle. Be careful to avoid splashing. Depending on the temperature of the wort, it may take a couple stones to get the\nwort to boil. Once it does get to a boil, it will boil vigorously. Add a stone about every 10min or whenever you notice\nthe surface of the wort stop to boil. Add your hop additions at their indicated times and enjoy the process. Chill down\nto pitching temps and then transfer to your fermenter. Pitch your yeast and let it ferment out for 10 days.

I found these 26in <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/dp/B01N654UZY/\">firewood tongs</a> on Amazon and decided to give them a shot. I’m happy to report they worked well. They are pretty thin so grabbing a rock the wrong way could easily mean accidentally dropping it so you need to make sure you have a good grip with them.</p>\n<div class=\"columns is-multiline\">\n    <div class=\"column is-10 is-offset-1\">\n        <img src=\"/2019/01/15/Homebrewing-A-Steinbier/firewood-tongs.jpg\" alt=\"Firewood Tongs in Action!\"/>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"column is-10 is-offset-1\">\n        <img src=\"/2019/01/15/Homebrewing-A-Steinbier/stones-in-wort.jpg\" alt=\"Stones and trub left in the kettle after the transfer..\"/>\n    </div>\n</div>\n\n<h3 id=\"Local-Malts-Cedar-Tips-and-Kveik\"><a href=\"#Local-Malts-Cedar-Tips-and-Kveik\" class=\"headerlink\" title=\"Local Malts, Cedar Tips, and Kveik!\"></a>Local Malts, Cedar Tips, and Kveik!</h3><p>While making a stienbier was unique enough, I wanted to go a little further with it. I had recently learned a small, artisan maltster in my area who had opened up earlier in 2018. They specialized in malting grains grown in the Midwest, including some red wheat that was grown just a couple counties over from where I live. I was super excited about the idea of using locally grown and malted grains in this beer so I reached out to <a href=\"http://gatewaymalt.com/\">Gateway Custom Malts</a> to see if I could get my hands on some of their malts. Not only did I get the malts but I was given a tour of their facility in Montgomery City which was pretty awesome.</p>\n<p>I also decided to try an ingredient I had been wanting to use for a while. Eastern Red Cedar is very common here in my area of the country. It is technically a species of juniper and it can be used in brewing in many different forms including the bark, berries and tips of the green branches. While the nuances of the flavor and aroma from the cedar tips can vary depending on location and time of year, the usually put off a crisp orange peel aroma and produce a piney green gin-like flavor.</p>\n<div class=\"columns is-multiline\">\n    <div class=\"column is-10 is-offset-1\">\n        <img src=\"/2019/01/15/Homebrewing-A-Steinbier/cedar-prep.jpg\" alt=\"Cedar Preparation.\"/>\n    </div>\n</div>\n\n<p>Once again, the folks at Scratch Brewing helped me out here. I referenced their <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Homebrewers-Almanac-Seasonal-Making-Scratch/dp/1581573499\">“The Homebrewer’s Almanac”</a> many times during the planning process for tips on brewing with cedar. If you are into using hyper local or foraged ingredients in your brews, this book is a fantastic reference!</p>\n<p>Before we get to the recipe, I’d like to talk about yeast choice. On a commercial scale, steinbiers are typically lagers. As far as I can find, there isn’t much of a reason behind this other than it’s just what has always been done. Since “steinbier” is more of a process vs a style, any yeast will do the job. Since I would not be able to provide very accurate temperature control for this beer, I decided to try <a href=\"https://omegayeast.com/yeast/norwegian-ales/hothead-ale\">Omega’s HotHead</a>. It is a strain of kviek yeast, which would play into some of the traditional Norwegian aspects of this beer by using cedar and boiling with rocks. Also, it can ferment at temps up to 98F which is ideal for the type of fermentation I was going to need to do with this beer. </p>\n<p>I grabbed a pack from my local shop but found it to be nearly 6 months old. I was a little nervous at first as it should have lost a lot of viability at that point. However, after talking to some folks who had worked with it before, they suggested that HotHead works really well when under-pitched and the smaller cell count wouldn’t have an issue with the higher gravity of my recipe. In short, don’t worry about under pitching this yeast. It had no issues getting going and making a great beer!</p>\n<h3 id=\"Recipe\"><a href=\"#Recipe\" class=\"headerlink\" title=\"Recipe\"></a>Recipe</h3><h6 id=\"Taken-for-Granite-Cedar-stienbier-5gal\"><a href=\"#Taken-for-Granite-Cedar-stienbier-5gal\" class=\"headerlink\" title=\"Taken for Granite - Cedar stienbier - 5gal\"></a>Taken for Granite - Cedar stienbier - 5gal</h6><p>OG: 1.068<br>24 IBu<br>5.7SRM</p>\n<h6 id=\"Malt\"><a href=\"#Malt\" class=\"headerlink\" title=\"Malt\"></a>Malt</h6><p>10lb \tGateway Custom Malt Violetta 2 Row<br>2lb \tGateway Custom Malt Soft Red Winter Wheat<br>.25lb\tCaramel 40</p>\n<h6 id=\"Hops\"><a href=\"#Hops\" class=\"headerlink\" title=\"Hops\"></a>Hops</h6><p>1oz Hallertau \t60min<br>1oz Citra\t10min</p>\n<h6 id=\"Yeast\"><a href=\"#Yeast\" class=\"headerlink\" title=\"Yeast\"></a>Yeast</h6><p>Omega OYL-057 HotHead Ale</p>\n<h6 id=\"Miscellaneous\"><a href=\"#Miscellaneous\" class=\"headerlink\" title=\"Miscellaneous\"></a>Miscellaneous</h6><p>6oz of green Eastern Red Cedar tips split between mash and sparge water.</p>\n<h3 id=\"Steps\"><a href=\"#Steps\" class=\"headerlink\" title=\"Steps\"></a>Steps</h3><p>Build a large fire around your stones and light it about 3-4 hours before you plan to boil your wort. You may need to<br>keep feeding the fire so it stays warm. Hardwoods like oak and elm will burn nice and hot and are excellent choices for<br>fuel.</p>\n<div class=\"columns is-multiline\">\n    <div class=\"column is-10 is-offset-1\">\n        <img src=\"/2019/01/15/Homebrewing-A-Steinbier/fire.jpg\" alt=\"Heating up the Granite.\"/>\n    </div>\n</div>\n\n<p>After the fire has burned for a couple hours, go ahead and prepare your mash. I choose to aim for a mash temp of 154F<br>for a nice medium-full bodied beer but this is open to your interpretation if you would like to try something different.<br>After mixing in the grains, I picked off about 3oz of cedar tips and threw them into the mash and stirred them in. If<br>you think a normal mash smells great and the smell of cedar is pleasant to you, prepare for some pretty awesome mash<br>smells.</p>\n<div class=\"columns is-multiline\">\n    <div class=\"column is-10 is-offset-1\">\n        <img src=\"/2019/01/15/Homebrewing-A-Steinbier/mash2.jpg\" alt=\"Mashing In.\"/>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"column is-10 is-offset-1\">\n        <img src=\"/2019/01/15/Homebrewing-A-Steinbier/mash1.jpg\" alt=\"Adding the Cedar to the Mash.\"/>\n    </div>\n</div>\n\n<p>I let it mash for 1 hour and then prepared my sparge water while I waited. I heated my sparge water to 165F and added 3<br>more ounces of cedar tips into the water in order to infuse it with those great cedar flavors. Once the hour timer was<br>up, I ran out the wort from the tun into my boil kettle and batch sparged with the cedar water to my boil volume.</p>\n<div class=\"columns is-multiline\">\n    <div class=\"column is-10 is-offset-1\">\n        <img src=\"/2019/01/15/Homebrewing-A-Steinbier/sparge-cedar.jpg\" alt=\"Adding the Cedar to the Sparge Water.\"/>\n    </div>\n</div>\n\n<p>This is where the fun begins. Using the tongs, grab a couple stones from the fire, one at a time, and place them in the<br>kettle. Be careful to avoid splashing. Depending on the temperature of the wort, it may take a couple stones to get the<br>wort to boil. Once it does get to a boil, it will boil vigorously. Add a stone about every 10min or whenever you notice<br>the surface of the wort stop to boil. Add your hop additions at their indicated times and enjoy the process. Chill down<br>to pitching temps and then transfer to your fermenter. Pitch your yeast and let it ferment out for 10 days. If you use<br>the Omega HotHead, make sure to let it ramp up to around 80f at least to ensure full attenuation.

This\nreaction produces a small amount of heat which can raise the temperature internally compared to the outside of the\nvessel.

You will want to thread the thermowell into the top of the tee, and the barb on the side.\nThis is the only way this configuration will work so it's pretty fail proof!  Don't forget to add thread tape to all of\nyour NPT connections.\n\n<div class=\"columns is-multiline\">\n    <div class=\"column is-10 is-offset-1\">\n        <img src=\"{% asset_path added-thermowell.jpg %}\" alt=\"Thermowell Added\" />\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"column is-10 is-offset-1\">\n        <img src=\"{% asset_path added-barb.jpg %}\" alt=\"Barb Added\" />\n    </div>\n</div>\n\nNext, if using a Blichmann Conical, you need to attach the Bottom Dump fitting. This is the same fitting used if you\npurchased their blowoff assembly and fits the pre-cut hole in the top of the conical.\n\n<div class=\"columns is-multiline\">\n    <div class=\"column is-10 is-offset-1\">\n        <img src=\"{% asset_path adapter1.jpg %}\" alt=\"Top of Bulkhead\" />\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"column is-10 is-offset-1\">\n        <img src=\"{% asset_path adapter2.jpg %}\" alt=\"Bottom of Bulkhead\" />\n    </div>\n</div>\n\nNow it should be very apparent how this is going to work. The thermowell will penetrate almost to the center of the\nvessel, while still leaving space within the NPT Tee for Co2 and yeast to blow out. The extra large 5/8\" Barb helps to\nensure we don't get any clogs. Most 1/2\" barbs inner diameter are a little smaller. Using a more flexible 1/2\" ID\nsilicon tube will go onto this barb fairly easily and end up in a blowoff bucket.\n\n<div class=\"columns is-multiline\">\n    <div class=\"column is-10 is-offset-1\">\n        <img src=\"{% asset_path underside.jpg %}\" alt=\"Thermowell/Blowoff Underside\" />\n    </div>\n</div>\n\nNow that it's put together, all we need to do it attach it to our Tri-Clamp bulkhead on the lid of our conical using our\ngasket and sanitary clamp.\n\n<div class=\"columns is-multiline\">\n    <div class=\"column is-half\">\n        <img src=\"{% asset_path clamp.jpg %}\" alt=\"Tri-Clamp\" />\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"column is-half\">\n        <img src=\"{% asset_path gasket.jpg %}\" alt=\"1.5in Gasket\" />\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"column is-10 is-offset-1\">\n        <img src=\"{% asset_path added-lid.jpg %}\" alt=\"Mounted to the bulkhead\"/>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"column is-10 is-offset-1\">\n        <img src=\"{% asset_path final.jpg %}\" alt=\"All Done!\" />\n    </div>\n</div>\n\n### Pushing with Pressure\n\nAnother advantage to this setup is being able to swap the barb out with any 1/2\" NPT fitting. When I am ready to cold\ncrash, I can take the barb off and put a smaller one on. Then, I can hook up my Co2 tank and add a small amount of\npressure to it. As the beer compresses due to the cold, I will be sure to keep a positive Co2 pressure within the\nvessel.\n\nLater, when I am ready to keg, I can apply more pressure to the vessel to force it into a keg.  This keeps a layer of Co2 present within the vessel and keeping oxygen out.\n","source":"_posts/Build-a-better-blowoff-assembly.md","raw":"---\ntitle: Build a better blowoff assembly\ncatalog: false\ndate: 2016-12-21 12:00:00\ntags:\n- blowoff\n- thermowell\n- blichmann\n- engineering\nsubtitle: Most seem to only offer a thermowell or blowoff tube.

It is a Blichmann 14 gallon Fermenator. I was in heaven. All the<br>shiny stainless and tri-clamp fittings. It was great, and it still is. Except one small problem: the 1.5” hole in the<br>top of the conical made for a bung and an airlock. Now in some cases, an airlock will work just fine. However, from my<br>experiences, 9 out of 10 times I am going to need a blowoff tube.</p>","more":"<h3 id=\"The-Dilemma\"><a href=\"#The-Dilemma\" class=\"headerlink\" title=\"The Dilemma\"></a>The Dilemma</h3><p>The only solution, and similar solutions for other conical brands, was to buy an expensive assembly that performed one<br>function. In particular to the Blichmann conical, the assembly runs for about $120-130 depending on where you shop.</p>\n<div class=\"columns is-multiline\">\n    <div class=\"column is-10 is-offset-1\">\n        <img src=\"/2016/12/21/Build-a-better-blowoff-assembly/blichmann-assembly.jpg\" alt=\"Blichmann Blowoff Assembly\"/>\n    </div>\n</div>\n\n<p>Now this isn’t saying it’s a bad product.

Having your probe on the outside of<br>your fermentation vessel doesn’t accurately portray whats going on inside. Fermentation is a chemical reaction. This<br>reaction produces a small amount of heat which can raise the temperature internally compared to the outside of the<br>vessel. There is also the case of the mass of fluid and the temperature differential between the outside edge and the<br>center of the vessel. The best way to determine the core temperature of your fermentation is with a thermowell.

But to my defense, there have been a ton of changes that have taken place to keep me occupied.  As the kids have gotten older, they have started more after school activities that keep us busy. Somewhere in there we moved houses, started dedicating more time to my homebrew competition system  project <a href=\"https://brewerwall.com/\">Brewerwall</a>.  I even changed jobs that focuses my attention more into the world of beer as a software engineer at <a href=\"https://www.precisionfermentation.com/\">Precision Fermentation</a>.</p>","more":"<h3 id=\"2018-through-2020\"><a href=\"#2018-through-2020\" class=\"headerlink\" title=\"2018 through 2020\"></a>2018 through 2020</h3><p>To be honest, I have never been much of a writer.  I like the idea of it, but getting my thoughts down has always been tough. Originally when starting this blog I thought I would keep it factual and with the topic around brewing it would keep me motivated. Alas, life, work and other projects kept me from adding to it.  Not that those reasons are bad things, it’s just the reality of it.</p>\n<p>During these couple of years I did brew plenty of beers, participated in festivals and had a great time with the hobby!  However, I ultimately failed at keeping any kind of blog alive.  My hope is to change that by coming up with a new routine and schedule.</p>\n<h3 id=\"A-New-Location\"><a href=\"#A-New-Location\" class=\"headerlink\" title=\"A New Location\"></a>A New Location</h3><p>In late 2020, during the peak of the pandemic, my wife and I found our forever home.
