### Mason Jars Work Great!

As long as you don't keep them air tight.  Over time, yeast will still produce small amounts of Co2.  This buildup, in such a small space, can happen quickly and doesn't take much gas to build up a considerable amount of pressure.  Fortunately for myself, I haven't had an explosion, but I have noticed a lot of my jars started to pop the top.

<!-- more -->

<div class="columns is-multiline">
    <div class="column is-10 is-offset-1">
        <img src="{% asset_path popped-lid.jpg %}" alt="Top of the lid has been pushed up."/>
    </div>
</div>

As the top becomes bent and the seal gets loose, Co2 is released.  This happens to cause the yeast to expand and sometimes foam.  Which has led to many of my jars leaking all over the place.

### Simple Solution

Put a hole in the top!  Some leave the lids on loose, but I always feared tipping the jar over and losing the entire harvest.  Putting a hole in the top minimized that while leaving a space for excess Co2 to be released.  To keep the buggins out, just slap a piece of tape on top.  This still allows for the gasses to release, but anything big from getting in.

<div class="columns is-multiline">
    <div class="column is-10 is-offset-1">
        <img src="{% asset_path punched-lid.jpg %}" alt="Couple of hits with a punch and hammer."/>
    </div>
    <div class="column is-10 is-offset-1">
        <img src="{% asset_path tape-lid.jpg %}" alt="Slap a little tape on top."/>
    </div>
</div>

Now you have a safe and cost effective way of storing yeast!
