# About

I started brewing in 2012.  Like a lot of others, my wife had bought me a Mr. Beer kit.  After doing a couple of kits, I was hooked.  From then on it was a series of learning, trying and expanding throughout the years.

Fullstack Brewing got its name coming from my career as a fullstack developer.  Someone who took on all aspects of a project from beginning to end.
