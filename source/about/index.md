# About

I first got the bug of homebrewing back in 2012. Like a lot of others, my wife had bought me a Mr. Beer kit. After doing a couple of kits, I was hooked. From there its been years of learning new techniques, gathering new equipment and updating my workflows.

Fullstack Brewing got the name coming from my career as a fullstack developer.
